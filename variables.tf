  default     = 256
  description = <<EOF
The amount of CPU units to reserve for the service.
1024 CPU units is roughly equivalent to 1 vCPU.
This means the default of 256 CPU units is roughly .25 vCPUs.
A vCPU is a virtualization of a physical CPU.

  description = <<EOF
The amount of memory to reserve and cap the service.
If the service exceeds this amount, the service will be killed with exit code 127 representing "Out-of-memory".
Memory is measured in MiB, or megabytes.
This means the default is 512 MiB or 0.5 GiB.
